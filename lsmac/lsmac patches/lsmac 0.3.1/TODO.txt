TODO.txt file for lsmac 0.3 created 06/04/2003.

/*  TODO
        
        * Bug - errors may occur when listing folders containing more than 9999 files.
        * Handle symlinks properly, i.e. not just list them as if they were the files they pointed to
        * Bug - lsmac reports error when traversing /dev.
        * Bug - Does not display size correctly for files larger than 4GB or so. 64bit int problem.
        * Try to optimize speed.  lsmac default output is 3x-4x slower than ls -l
        * Optimize memory usage
        * Accept more than one argument to list, and, on a similar note...
            * Make lsmac accept files as command line parameter, and then just print the info about those files
        * Implement calculation of folder sizes - recursively scan through hierarchy and add up total size
        * Display folder flags from the DInfo structure
        * There is other Mac file meta-data not available via FSpGetFInfo() which should also be listed, f.e. comments
        * -x option: list file suffixes in a seperate column
        * List total size of all files listed on top, akin to ls -l
