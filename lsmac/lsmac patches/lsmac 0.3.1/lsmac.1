.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Ar lsmac
is an ls-like utility for listing the files contained given directory on a HFS or HFS+ volume and the MacOS
meta-data associated with them.  The output is akin to that of the ls long view.  Each line follows the format below:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Begins a tagged list 
.It [Finder flags] [file type] [creator type] [size] [name or path]
.El                      \" Ends the list
.Pp
By default, 
.Ar lsmac 
does not display file size and only lists the file name.  In the case of directories, only the name or 
path is listed.
.Pp
The Finder flags of each file are displayed as a sequence of six characters.  Each character indicates whether one 
of the following flags are set:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Begins a tagged list
.It I
File has the Invisible flag set
.It C
File has the Custom Icon flag set
.It L
File is Name Locked (i.e. it is a system file)
.It B
File has the Bundle bit flag set
.It A
File has the Alias flag set
.It S
File has the Stationery flag set
.El      
.Pp
An '-' indicates that a flag is not set.  For example, a file with none of the Finder flags set would be listed as '------' while
a file with all the flags set would be listed as 'ICLBAS'.
.Pp
.Ar lsmac
accepts the following options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed 
.It Fl v                 \"-a flag as a list item
Prints version and author and then exits
.It Fl h
Prints help
.It Fl f[fork]
Specify which forks to count when calculating file size.  You can specify fork as 'rsrc', 'data' or 'both' (minus quote marks).
.It Fl b
Display file size in bytes (i.e. 12977128 bytes)
.It Fl o
Omit folders when listing directory contents
.It Fl F
Only list folders when listing directory contents
.It Fl a
Display all files, including files with the . prefix.
.It Fl p
Display full file paths instead of file names
.It Fl Q
Display file name or path within quotation marks (").
.It Fl l
When listing file size, use physical size instead of logical size.
